# Detecting and Forecasting Crime Hotspots using Spatio-Temporal Analysis  

## Overview  
This project focuses on detecting and forecasting crime hotspots by combining **spatial** and **temporal** analysis techniques.  
- **Spatial Analysis:** Getis-Ord Gi* statistics to identify crime clusters.  
- **Temporal Forecasting:** Prophet model to predict future crime trends.  
- **Visualization:** Interactive visualizations created with Plotly for better insights.  

The goal is to help law enforcement agencies and policymakers take **data-driven decisions** for crime prevention and resource allocation.
